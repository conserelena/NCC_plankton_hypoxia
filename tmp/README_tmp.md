#### README- Tmp 

This subdirectory has intermediate figures and table tables from the exploratory phase, as well as other figures made in the intermediary. 

These outputs come from the code files `data_exploration.R` and `transect_maps.R`. 

`./data_exploration/proportion_taxa_occurence.csv` is a table of the proportion of depth bins in which there are non-zero values for taxa, and sorted from smallest to largest to identify which groups may be too rare of scarce for analyses. 

`./data_exploration/histograms/` contains histograms of bin abundance, log(x+1) transformed.
